# slimpd
PHP/JS/MySQL based MPD-web-client for large music collections
heavily inspired by http://ompd.pl

current development status is pretty alpha because tons of basic features are missing

## goals
* massive performance one large music collections - especially the database-update after the initial update
* unifiying of misspelled or different notations of tag information
* extracting useable information from filesystem of music files with no tags
* non-destructive approach (your music-collection wont get touched at all)
* separate linking of each remixers and featured artists
* localization of the whole frontend
* mobile friendly
* displaying waveforms of currently played track
* choose between controlling MPD and playing files directly in browser
